PROJECT: Finis Oculus Dashboard 2.0 ("The "Wow" Factor)
CLIENT: Finis Oculus
FROM: $10M Design Agency
DATE: 2025-11-14

PHILOSOPHY:
The current dashboard is functional. A $10M dashboard is **experiential**. It should feel less like a tool and more like a personalized, intelligent financial co-pilot. The user shouldn't just *read* data; they should *interact* with it and feel understood. The "Oculus" (eye) theme implies clarity and vision. Our design must deliver this.

We will achieve this through three pillars:
1.  **Hyper-Personalization:** The dashboard must feel like it was built *for the user* and *only* the user.
2.  **Data as an Experience:** Transform static numbers into beautiful, interactive, and insightful visualizations that tell a story.
3.  **Living App:** The app must feel alive, breathing with real-time market data and AI insights.

---
### SECTION 1: THE "DAILY BRIEFING" (New Component)
---

**GOAL:** Immediately hook the user with personalized value. Replace the generic "Market Overview" as the primary element.

+   **Personalized Greeting:**
    * "Good morning, [User Name]. Here is your 1-minute briefing."

+   **Watchlist AI Summary:**
    * A headline that summarizes the user's *entire watchlist*.
    * "Overall, your watchlist sentiment is **Strongly Positive (+0.34)**."
    * "You have **3 new AI 'Buy' signals** and **1 new 'Sell' signal** to review."

+   **"What's Happening" Module:**
    * A 3-item list of the most critical events *right now* related to their holdings.
    * `[AAPL]`: "Is trending on social media, with sentiment shifting negative."
    * `[MSFT]`: "Has a new 'Golden Cross' technical signal detected by our AI."
    * `[Market]`: "The S&P 500 Sentiment just crossed into 'Negative' territory."

---
### SECTION 2: THE "MARKET PULSE" (Replaces Market Overview)
---

**GOAL:** Reframe the generic market data through the unique "Finis Oculus" lens.

* **AI-Powered Indices:**
    * Don't just show the S&P 500 price. Show *our* data.
    * "S&P 500: 5,432.10 (+0.5%)"
    * "S&P 500 AI Sentiment: **Neutral (-0.02)**"

+   **Sentiment Heatmap (New Component):**
    * A small, visual heatmap of the 11 major market sectors (Tech, Health, etc.).
    * The color of each block is not price change, but *our AI sentiment score*.
    * This is visually stunning and provides an instant, unique-to-us market overview.

+   **New Data Categories:**
    * Create toggleable tabs.
    * `Top Movers` (Price-based, everyone has this)
    * `Top Sentiment Shifts` (Our data, this is the "wow")
    * `Most Discussed` (Social media volume)

---
### SECTION 3: THE "LIVING" WATCHLIST (Enhancement)
---

**GOAL:** Make the watchlist the interactive, high-utility centerpiece of the dashboard.

+   **View Toggle:**
    * **Grid View (Current):** Simple, visual, with enhanced `StockCard`s.
    * **"Pro" List View:** A dense, data-rich table for power users. Columns: Ticker | Price | % Change | **Sentiment** | **AI Signal (Buy/Sell)** | Volume | Sparkline.
    * **"Oculus" Heatmap View:** A full-screen version of the Sector Heatmap, but for the user's *entire watchlist*.

* **Enhanced StockCard (`StockCard 2.0`):**
    * Keep the existing data (price, sparkline).
    * Add the **AI Signal** as a small, colored "badge" (e.g., "BUY", "SELL").
    * The border of the card itself should have a subtle "glow" based on sentiment (green for positive, red for negative).
    * On hover, the sparkline animates and reveals more data.

+   **Quick-Action Menu:**
    * Add a "..." button to each `StockCard`.
    * On click, show a small menu: `Remove from Watchlist` | `Set Alert` | `View Top Insights`.

---
### SECTION 4: "OCULUS AI FEED" (New Component)
---

**GOAL:** Make the AI the hero. This is the "Instagram feed" for their stocks, making the app addictive and indispensable.

+   **Real-Time Insights Feed:**
    * A dedicated, scrolling panel on the dashboard.
    * Shows a timestamped feed of AI-generated insights for stocks *in their watchlist*.
    * `10:32 AM [AAPL]`: "AI detected a 40% spike in social media volume, correlating with a -0.15 sentiment drop."
    * `10:30 AM [MSFT]`: "A new 'Golden Cross' technical signal has formed on the 50/200-day moving average."
    * `10:28 AM [TSLA]`: "Sentiment-driving news detected: 'Tesla recalls 50,000 vehicles...'"
    * This proves the app is *always working* for the user and makes it feel alive.

---
### SECTION 5: "WOW" POLISH & UTILITY
---

+   **Command Palette (Cmd+K):**
    * A floating search bar (like in Slack or Vercel) activated by `Cmd+K`.
    * User can type: `AAPL` (to go to the stock page), `Add TSLA` (to add to watchlist), `Go to Settings`, `Toggle Theme`.
    * This is the ultimate pro-user "wow" feature.

+   **Smarter Onboarding:**
    * The first time a user visits the dashboard, it should *not* be empty.
    * Show a welcome modal: "Welcome to Finis Oculus. We've added a few popular stocks to your watchlist to get you started."
    * Pre-populate the watchlist with `AAPL`, `GOOG`, and `TSLA`.
    * This *immediately* shows the user the value (StockCards, AI data) instead of giving them a blank screen and a "to-do" item.

+   **Visual Polish:**
    * **Aurora/Glow Effects:** Use subtle, colored, blurred glows (like in your `HeroVisual`) as backgrounds for the main dashboard panels. The glow can subtly shift based on overall market sentiment (green/red).
    * **Micro-interactions:** When a stock is added, don't just pop a toast. Have the `StockCard` animate in and find its place in the grid.
