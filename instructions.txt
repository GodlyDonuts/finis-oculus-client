Phenomenal UI/UX Plan V2: The Living App

The V1 enhancements established a phenomenal brand identity and data-rich layout/page.tsx]. V2 focuses on bringing the app *alive* with advanced interactivity, deeper "AI" integration, and simulating a real-time data environment.

---
1. Interactivity & Data Polish
---

Action 1.1: Interactive Chart-Header Connection
* **File:** `app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`
* **Goal:** Make the stock detail chart feel like a professional tool by linking it directly to the page's main price header.
* **Instruction:** The main price header (e.g., "$189.99") and change (e.g., "+1.20 (0.64%)") should update *dynamically* as the user hovers over the price chart/page.tsx].
* **Implementation:**
    1.  Create two state variables: `[hoveredPrice, setHoveredPrice]` and `[hoveredChange, setHoveredChange]`.
    2.  In the `<ResponsiveContainer>` for the `AreaChart`, add the `onMouseMove` prop. This event provides the active data point.
    3.  Inside `onMouseMove`, check if there's an active payload. If so, `setHoveredPrice` to the price from that data point. (You'll also need to calculate the change relative to the *previous* data point or the opening price).
    4.  Add an `onMouseLeave` prop to the chart to reset `setHoveredPrice(null)`.
    5.  Modify the header's text elements to render `hoveredPrice ?? data.price` and `hoveredChange ?? data.change`. This will show the live hovered price when active, and fall back to the main price when not.

Action 1.2: Animated Numbers on Load
* **Files:** `components/StockCard.tsx`, `app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`
* **Goal:** Make price and sentiment changes feel more impactful and less static on load. We already have `framer-motion`.
* **Instruction:** Use `framer-motion`'s `animate` property to make key numbers "count up" when the component loads.
* **Implementation:**
    1.  This is easiest to implement directly on the text element.
    2.  **In `components/StockCard.tsx`:**
        * Import `motion` from `framer-motion`.
        * Change the price `<span>` to `<motion.span>`.
        * Add the props: `initial={{ opacity: 0 }}`, `animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`, and `transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}`.
        * (For a true number count-up, you would use `useSpring` or `animate` from `framer-motion`, but a simple fade-in is a great start).
    3.  **In `app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`:**
        * Apply the same `<motion.span>` with `initial`, `animate`, and `transition` props to the main price (`$189.99`) and the AI sentiment score (`+0.82`). This will make them pop in gracefully as the page animates.

2. Deepen the "AI" Promise
---

Action 2.1: "AI-Generated Insights" Component
* **File:** `app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`
* **Goal:** Add another tangible "AI" output to the stock detail page, reinforcing the app's value proposition.
* **Instruction:** Below the "Key Statistics" card, add a new "AI-Generated Insights" card.
* **Mock Data:** Add this new array to your `mockStockDetails` object:
    ```json
    "aiInsights": [
      { "id": 1, "insight": "Positive sentiment is 82% correlated with recent 'Apple Intelligence' news flow.", "type": "correlation" },
      { "id": 2, "insight": "Price movement shows potential resistance near $192.50.", "type": "technical" },
      { "id": 3, "insight": "Social media volume is 25% higher than average, indicating high retail interest.", "type": "social" }
    ]
    ```
* **UI:**
    1.  Create a new `<Card>`.
    2.  Map over the `aiInsights` array.
    3.  For each insight, display it in a list. Each item should have a small icon from `lucide-react` based on its `type` (e.g., `Zap` for "correlation", `BarChart3` for "technical", `Users` for "social").

Action 2.2: Polish the Auth Experience
* **Files:** `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`
* **Goal:** Ensure the login/signup experience matches the new premium brand identity from V1.
* **Instruction:** The auth pages are unbranded. Let's apply our new identity.
* **UI:**
    1.  **Branded Column:** On the right-hand `bg-muted` column, replace the `<h2>Finis Oculus</h2>` text with the same `<Image src="/logo.svg" ... />` component and `<span className="font-serif-display">Finis Oculus</span>` you used in the `Header.tsx`. This creates brand consistency.
    2.  **Serif Headings:** Add the `font-serif-display` class to the main `CardTitle` on both pages ("Login" and "Create Account").
    3.  **Button:** The main "Login" / "Sign Up" button should already be using the new "fintech green" primary color from the `globals.css` update. This is just a check to ensure it looks correct.

3. The "Living" App (Simulation)
---

Action 3.1: Simulate Real-Time Updates
* **Files:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`
* **Goal:** Make the app feel like it's connected to a live market feed, which is critical for a "pro" tool.
* **Instruction:** Use a `setInterval` in a `useEffect` to periodically update the mock data state.
* **Implementation (Dashboard):**
    1.  **File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
    2.  In the `useEffect` where you set the watchlist data, add a `setInterval` (e.g., every 3 seconds).
    3.  Inside the interval, update the `watchlist` state (`setWatchlist`). Map over the previous state, and for each stock, return a new object with a slightly randomized price: `price: stock.price + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.5`.
    4.  Make sure to clear this interval in the `useEffect`'s cleanup function (`return () => clearInterval(intervalId);`).
* **Implementation (Stock Detail):**
    1.  **File:** `app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`
    2.  Use the same `setInterval` pattern to update your `mockStockDetails` state.
    3.  **Crucial Micro-interaction:** When the `price` updates, trigger the `flash-green` animation we already added to `globals.css`.
    4.  To do this, create a `useState` for a flash key: `[flashKey, setFlashKey] = useState(0)`.
    5.  In the interval, when you set the new price, also update the key: `setFlashKey(k => k + 1)`.
    6.  Apply this key to the price `<span>` element: `<span key={flashKey} className="... flash-green">...</span>`. Changing the `key` will force React to re-render that specific element, re-triggering the CSS animation.

Action 3.2: Create a Stock Detail Skeleton
* **Goal:** Improve perceived performance. When a user clicks a `StockCard`, they should see an instant layout shift to the detail page's *skeleton* before the data "loads."
* **Instruction:**
    1.  Create a new file: `components/StockDetailPageSkeleton.tsx`.
    2.  Inside this file, build a skeleton component that *mimics the layout* of `app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`. Use the `<Skeleton>` component.
        * It should have a skeleton for the `h1` and price.
        * It should have a `lg:col-span-2` skeleton for the AI Summary and Price Chart.
        * It should have a `lg:col-span-1` column with skeletons for the AI Sentiment and Key Stats cards.
    3.  **File:** `app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`
    4.  Introduce a new loading state: `[isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)`.
    5.  Wrap your `mockStockDetails` in a `useState` as well: `[stockData, setStockData] = useState(null)`.
    6.  In your `useEffect`, simulate a fetch (e.g., `setTimeout(1000)`). After the timeout, set `setStockData(mockStockDetails)` and `setIsLoading(false)`.
    7.  In the `return()`:
        * `if (isLoading || !stockData) { return <StockDetailPageSkeleton />; }`
        * Render your *actual* page content using the `stockData` state variable.
